# Crypto Blockchain Project

Welcome to the Crypto Blockchain project! I built this project following the Udemy course 
[Harness the power of the most disruptive technology since the internet through real life examples! Master Blockchain Now]
https://www.udemy.com/course/build-your-blockchain-az/learn/lecture/9657332 . 
I actively code, deploy, and test each component to demonstrate blockchain, cryptocurrency, and smart contract technology.

## Overview

I built a blockchain in Python and deployed a smart contract in Solidity. 
I connect multiple nodes to create a decentralized network and implement a coin ICO smart contract. 
I use real-life examples from the course to actively show how these technologies work together.

## Course Details

- **Course Title:** Harness the power of the most disruptive technology since the internet through real life examples! Master Blockchain Now
- **Course URL:** [Udemy Course Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-your-blockchain-az/learn/lecture/9657332)
- **Course Content:**
  - Blockchain and cryptocurrency theory
  - Practical programming of blockchain and decentralized networks in Python
  - Smart contract development in Solidity

## Project Structure

- **Blockchain Module (Python):**  
  I create the blockchain, manage transactions, and enable mining via Flask-based API endpoints.

- **Decentralized Network (Python):**  
  I connect nodes to form a live decentralized network.

- **Smart Contract (Solidity):**  
  I develop a coin ICO contract that allows investors to buy and sell coins.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** I program blockchain and network functionalities.
- **Flask:** I expose API endpoints and build a web interface.
- **Solidity:** I develop and test the smart contract.
- **Remix IDE:** I compile and deploy the Solidity contract.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- Flask (install with `pip install flask`)  
- Hashlib
- Remix IDE (available at [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/))
